## Welcome to Rose's Project 2!
This project involved CLI, refactoring and Git within visual studio code.


### CLI
We started by using a number of different commands within the terminal to essentially create, chnage, initialize and commit new folders and files.

### JavaScript Aspect
In p2-random.js, I created a new function call getRandomLetter that returned a random, single lowercase letter. I then staged and comitted this change.
What i learned the most from this project was how to reduce functions into single lines instead of having 5-10 lines.
